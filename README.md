# Face Expression Prediction

This is a jupyter notebook for recognizing live facial expressions using *Tensorflow* and *opencv*.

Firstly Tensorflow is used to train the model. For training and testing purpose the dataset which was used is available here :-
After that we created a **CNN** Model with firstl three convolutional layers after that a flatten layerand after that two fully connected layer. Finally the model was compiled.
The visual model architecture looks like as given below :-
